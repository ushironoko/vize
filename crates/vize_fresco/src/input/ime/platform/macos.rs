//! macOS-specific IME handling.
//!
//! On macOS, terminal apps can use the Text Input Source Services API
//! to query and control the system IME. However, direct integration
//! is limited compared to GUI applications.

// TODO: Implement macOS-specific IME features
// - TISCopyCurrentKeyboardInputSource for input source detection
// - NSTextInputClient integration (if possible in terminal context)
